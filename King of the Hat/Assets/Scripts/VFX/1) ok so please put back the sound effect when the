1) ok so please put back the sound effect when they solve the destruction puzzle it's no longer in puzzle mode


2) when the gm selects an alien when the game is running as random alien ( we tend to pick a player when the game is running) the system needs to know that its now the original alien team so that the scoreboard shows stuff


//3) Another selection for scoreboard that will show the group in game


4) Multiple groups creator, (really needed)


//5) War Modes game stats need to be stored


??? 6) please check that when there is a broken traces and we run a corporate that it allocates traces correctly, last time I did it I selected 9 players, ??? had a broken trace but people could sign in up to 11 in that group



//7) button that will bring all groups down and out of the game



//8 Please move the button add test player above wait list



//9) Move the scoreboard drop down where add test player button is



//10) Please make the stop sfx button a toggle so that you can run games without sfx if you press it and if you press it again it puts them back
//please do these chagnes and test it, if you say its done please make sure its tested
//also every time you add something and its test it please post on the page
//one by one as you do it!



//11) Make the titles smaller, the puzzle manager and gun manager and timer need to be in one window and if the traces can also be in that window that //would be amazing, but its not required
